            <p>JoyArt was an event hosted for two years by Becker College students, intended to celebrate the work of college students studying game art. After the school shut down, so did the event. My team chose to bring it back, and to bring it to WPI's Seaport location in Boston to increase accessibility of the event to schools around Massachusetts. I lead the charge on this particular event.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over 200 submissions received from 12 different schools.</li>
